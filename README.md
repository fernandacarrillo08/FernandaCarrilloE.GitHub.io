# WORLD BANK DATASET 

The [World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org) provides large amounts of information about different country indicators, such as: 

1. Education 
1. Gender 
1. Nutrition 
1. Economy 
1. Environment
1. Politics 

This dataset can help us understand more about the situation in different nations around the world, we can compare them and 
also find out more about the relationship between some of these indicators. The information retrieved from this data can
be used to improve the countries such as getting people out of poverty or working towards gender equality. 


# MODELING WITH DATA: Tools and techniques for scientific computing 

The book [Modeling with Data](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691133140/modeling-with-data) would be very helpful 
in developing skills in computation. Without some kind of computation, having a lot of data is not as useful. Being able to clean, 
prepare, process, and analyze the data is key in order to take advantage of all the information available.
